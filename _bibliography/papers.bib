  title={SMS-MPC: Adversarial Learning-based Simultaneous Prediction Control with Single Model for Mobile Robots},
  abstract={Model predictive control is a promising method in robot control tasks. How to design an effective model structure and efficient prediction framework for model predictive control is still an open challenge. To reduce the time consumption and avoid compounding-error of the multi-step prediction process in model predictive control, we propose a single-model simultaneous framework, which uses single dynamics model to predict the entire prediction horizon simultaneously by taking all control actions with the current state as inputs. Based on this framework, we further propose an adversarial dynamics model that contains two parts. The generator provides a dynamics model for the prediction process, while the discriminator provides constraints that are hard to describe by manually defined loss. This adversarial dynamics model can accelerate training and improve model accuracy in unstructured environments. Experiments conducted in Gazebo simulator and on a real mobile robot demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the single-model simultaneous framework with an adversarial dynamics model.},

  title={Speed Planning Based on Terrain-Aware Constraint Reinforcement Learning in Rugged Environments}, 
  abstract={Speed planning in rugged terrain poses challenges due to various constraints, such as traverse efficiency, dynamics, safety, and smoothness. This paper introduces a framework based on Constrained Reinforcement Learning (CRL) that considers all these constraints. In addition, extracting the terrain information as a constraint to be added to the CRL is also a barrier. In this paper, a terrain constraint extraction module is designed to quantify the semantic and geometric attributes of the terrain by estimating maximum safe speed. All networks are trained on simulators or datasets and eventually deployed on a real mobile robot. To continuously improve the planning performance and mitigate the error caused by the simulator-reality gap, we propose a feedback structure for detecting and preserving critical experiences during the testing process. The experiments in the simulator and the real robot demonstrate that our method can reduce the frequency of dangerous status by 45% and improve up to 71% smoothness.},

  title={SCOML: Trajectory Planning Based on Self-Correcting Meta-Reinforcement Learning in Hybrid Terrain for Mobile Robot},
  abstract={Trajectory planning is important for ground robots to achieve safe and efficient autonomous navigation in unstructured off-road environments. Most existing methods treat each terrain as a single type. However, in the real world, a ground usually consists of hybrid terrains. In this work, we propose a novel trajectory planning network that handles hybrid terrain. To further enhance safety, we have designed a self-correcting structure based on historical planning data. This structure can correct the trajectory when an inappropriate one is planned. To train the network, we introduce a two-stage training scheme based on Offline Meta-Reinforcement Learning, which can train the network with pre-collected non-optimal datasets and reduce the occurrence of hazardous planning. The proposed approach has been evaluated on both simulated datasets and a real robot platform. Compared to state-of-the-art baseline methods, the proposed approach reduces hazardous planning by 59.3% in hybrid terrains.},
